# Java-Techincal-Training
fast AND lean code to solve problems compnes expect
lesss time,less meemory
less time complexity
less space complexity
data structue and algorith is programng
learn:
how to chose proper algorithm
competitive cding:
solving problems ,chooisng right datastructure and right algoerithm
Data stru cture:
primituive data types:
int,double,long,string(we use),char
wrapper claases:
integer class,double class,charecter class,string class
collections
list,sets,maps,stacks and queues
user-defined datastructures:
linked list,single,double,circular,tree,graph,binary tree,n-ary tree
................................................................................
algorrithms:
if,for,while,do-while,continue,break methods used by all algorithms
class:
paramenters,methods,instance,object
final,static,super
brute force-using no algorithm
two pointer technique,three pointer techniques **(30% of problems can be solved)
fixed window,variable size window
recursion **
branch and bound
gready algo
back tracking
dynamic programing ***
70% recurin+dynamic programing(problems can be sloved)
............................................................................
reading skills+math u need to understand the problem(math upto 12)+datastructea+algorithmas==skillset(50%)
u neeed to understand the problem(reading ccomprehension)
common sense
